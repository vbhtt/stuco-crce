Timelined is a customizable CSS-only vertical timeline.

#### Dynamic (AngularJS) Demo - http://timelined.andriaus.lt/angular (https://github.com/andriussev/timelined-angular)

## Quick start

### Grab the compiled code
The [compiled SCSS code](https://github.com/andriussev/timelined/raw/master/css/timeline.min.css) is the `css` directory, which will work fully work without the need of compiling anything. Don't forget to grab the [`demo.html` file](https://github.com/andriussev/timelined/raw/master/demo.html) too, to get the idea of how the tool works.

### Compiling
The styling is done with SCSS and you can compile it with any proper tool (I use [node-sass](https://github.com/sass/node-sass)). There are a couple of variables and other stuff to make the customization faster.

### Usage

#### Basic structure

	<div class="timeline gray-blue"> <!-- Main element container -->
		<div class="timeline-block">	<!-- Single block -->
			<div class="timeline-icon"></div> <!-- Icon on the timeline -->
			<div class="timeline-content"> 
				<p> Any content </p> <!-- Content -->
				<div class="timeline-date">Yesterday</div> <!-- Date -->
			</div>
		</div>
		...
	</div>

##### Additional options
Some additional customization is available by adding additional classes to the main container element `.timeline`:

* `.timeline-left` - The line is on the left while the content is always on the right;
* `.timeline-alternating` - Blocks are alternating between left and right of the line;
* `.timeline-collapsing` - The timeline automatically switches to `timeline-left` mode when the container is small (800px, by default);
* `.timeline-with-arrows` - Includes the arrows towards the line (works with default and left modes).

`.timeline-icon` element options:

* `.timeline-icon-hide-border` - Removes the border from the icon circle.

#### Timeline icons
As of now, Font Awesome icons can be used, as well as images:
	
	<div class="timeline-icon timeline-icon-hide-border"> <!-- Hiding border is optional -->
		<i class="fa fa-github fa-lg"></i>
	</div>
	<!-- Or -->
	<div class="timeline-icon">
		<img src="http://lorempixel.com/100/100/"/>
	</div>
#### Hide timeline content - timeline icon only
If you don't want to show the timeline content in the block, add `.timeline-block-icon-only` class on `timeline-block`. This makes the `.timeline-content` invisible.

Furthermore, if you want to enter text instead of an icon (or an image), add `.timeline-icon-text` to `.timeline-icon` div. You might want to also use `.timeline-icon-hide-border` in addition.
Adding the text content to a `span` container will give it the default background and border.

Basic example of how everything would work:

	<div class="timeline-block timeline-block-icon-only">
		<div class="timeline-icon timeline-icon-text timeline-icon-hide-border">
			<span>This is my important text</span>
		</div>
		<div class="timeline-content"></div>
	</div>



#### Additional schemes

Schemes are a quick way to change the color of the line, icon on the timeline and  border of the block. The names are self-explanitory: `gray-red`, `gray-blue`, `blue-yellow-yellow`, `purple-flirt`,`blue-blue-blue`.
Adding the scheme name as a class on the main container will do the job.
